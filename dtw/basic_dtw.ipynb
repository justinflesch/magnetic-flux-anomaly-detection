    "# Dynamic Time Warping\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic time warping (dtw) is the comparison between two sequences. This generally the comparison of two data points of different time frames. This has been used in accelarations and decelrations, audio, video, graphics data, etc. There are specific rules of dtw specified below:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Every index from the first sequence must be matched with one or more indices from the other sequence, and vice versa.\n",
    "- The first index from the first sequence must be matched with the first index from the other sequence (but it does not have to be its only match)\n",
    "- The last index from the first sequence must be matched with the last index from the other sequence (but it does not have to be its only match)\n",
    "- The mapping of the indices from the first sequence to indices from the other sequence must be monotonically increasing, and vice versa, i.e. if $j>i$ are indices from the first sequence, then there must not be two indices $l>k$ in the other sequence, such that index $i$ is matched with index $l$ and index $j$ is matched with index $k$, and vice versa.\n",
